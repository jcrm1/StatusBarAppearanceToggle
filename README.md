# StatusBarAppearanceToggle
Mac app to add a Status Bar icon you can click to change between light and dark mode.  
ONLY WORKS ON macOS/OS X.  
Uses AppleScript/osascript.  
I highly recommend using a jar-to-app-bundle packager, but it can be run from the command line without issues.  
I use Export as Runnable JAR File in Eclipse without issue.  
The icons are from Google, and they look best on devices/versions of macOS where the status bar changes color with light and dark mode. Originally created for an iMac on macOS 10.14.4 (Mojave).
